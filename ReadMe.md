# Computational Imaging Codebase

This repository includes notebooks support the textbook **Computational Optical Imaging **


Compuational Imaging is offered as course number 556 in Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona and Computational Photography is offered as OPTI 600C. Both courses use this text which covers:

* forward models
* inverse problems
* computational imaging using ray optics
* computational imaging using wave optics
* computational imaging using focal optics
* discrete sampling for digital photography
* neural image compression, image estimation and camera control
* array cameras
* dynamic control and sampling
